## Personal involvement

The activities on GitHub absolutely does not represent the personal involvement. Few members of the group found it hard using github's interface, especially with eclipse because it was causing a lot of problems and as we wanted to be as effective as possible and didn't want to impair member's of the group's work, the ones that had a hard time working with github worked directly on the code with their teamates

Repartition of tasks:

- GUI : Stella
- AES part: Karen
